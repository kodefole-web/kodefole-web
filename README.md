My name is Kyle Efole & 
I’m an aspiring Cybersecurity professional looking to acquire an entry-level Security Analyst position. I have hands-on experience in **incident response, memory forensics, malware analysis, threat hunting, and IDS rule engineering.

 🛡️ Featured Incident Response Projects

Here are my four end-to-end IR case studies using real security tools and workflows:

 🔹 [Imperial Memory – Memory Forensics](https://github.com/kodefole-web/Incident-Response-Imperial-Memory-)
Memory forensics using **Volatility** to extract credentials, decrypt an encrypted archive, and identify hidden indicators from a memory dump.

 🔹 [Mail & Trail – Splunk Log Analysis & Threat Hunting](https://github.com/kodefole-web/Incident-Response-Mail-and-Trail-)
Investigated malicious URL activity captured in a honeypot using **Telnet, Splunk, SPL queries, VirusTotal, and Base64 decoding**.

 🔹 [One of Us – Malware Triage & Backdoor Trojan Analysis](https://github.com/kodefole-web/Incident-Response-One-of-Us-)
Triaged **271 suspicious files** using VirusTotal and ClamAV to identify a Trojan with a Meterpreter-style backdoor and extract its MD5 hash.

 🔹 [Pigs Rule – Network Traffic Analysis & Snort Rule Engineering](https://github.com/kodefole-web/Incident-Response-Pigs-Rule-)
Analyzed **tcpdump packet captures**, detected suspicious RDP traffic on port 3389, and wrote custom **Snort IDS rules** to generate alerts visualized in Snorby.
